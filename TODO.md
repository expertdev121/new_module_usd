# TODO List for Fixing Sidebar and Delete Confirmation

- [x] Add "Accounts" navigation item to sidebar for non-super_admin users in `components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx`
- [x] Replace browser confirm alert with Dialog component for delete confirmation in `app/admin/accounts/page.tsx`
- [ ] Test the changes: Verify sidebar shows Accounts option and delete uses popup dialog
- [x] Add space between label and field in account forms (add/edit dialogs) in `app/admin/accounts/page.tsx`
